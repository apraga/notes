= Review (second pass)

Authors have answered adequately to the concerns raised in the first version. This new version is much more readable and understandable.

Two follow-up questions :

1. The C++ version on the host is slower to the Fortran. Could refactorization or aggressive compiler optimization decrease the gap with the Fortran version ?
2. If possible, the authors should share their data (table, plotting figures) for reproducibility. Ideally, the source code should be acessible but I understand that may not be possible.

Therefore, I am in favor of accepting the manuscript.
