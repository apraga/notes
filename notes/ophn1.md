(2021) characterize the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level role of Oligophrenin-1 in prefrontal parvalbumin interneurons, demonstrating that loss of Ophn1 function in these neurons is a mechanism for increased susceptibility to stress in intellectual disability caused by OPHN1 mutations.}

abstract = {Abstract Mutations in the OPHN1 gene cause a rare X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, variably associated with cerebellar hypoplasia and distinctive facial appearance. In most of cases so far reported, the identified genomic variants involve the region encoding the central RhoGAP domain of the oligophrenin-1 protein, and are predicted to result in a complete loss of function. By using a NGS-based diagnostic approach, we identified three male and a female patients from two unrelated families carrying novel non-disruptive OPHN1 variants (the in-frame c.116\_127 deletion and the missense c.2129C>T change, respectively), affecting either the BAR domain or the C-terminus proline-rich domain of the protein. Clinical and neuroimaging findings in the patients recapitulated the main features of OPHN1-related syndrome, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral disorder, dysmorphic features, seizures, cerebellar hypoplasia, and ventriculomegaly. Yet, we observed a wide variability even among affected siblings, confirming the lack of clear genotype–phenotype correlation. Our results expand the allelic spectrum of OPHN1 and illustrate the challenges for clinical interpretation of non-disruptive variants affecting X-linked genes.},
