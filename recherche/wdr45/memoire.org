Here we report two variants in four patients. While two
** Family 1
- familial history: renal agenesis for the paternal grand-father, epilepsy in the maternal cousin of the mother
- 1 healthy sibling, French parents
*** Patient 1
  - pregnancy, birth N
  - age ??
  - neonatal: poor suckling
  - langage lay + fine motor difficulties
  - overlapping of left toes, mild hypertonia of lower limbs, mild dysmorphic features with bilateral epicanthus and hooded eyelids.
  - no epilepsy
  - metabolic, ophtalmologic, hearing N
  - MRI : bilateral and symmetric hypersignal of dentate nucleus in T2, without iron deposition
*** Patient 2 = sister
  - pregnancy, birth N
  - language delay, learning difficulties
  - round face, thick hair, short forehead and a right preaurical fistula.
  - hypermetropia and astigmatism
  - 12 years, no MRI
*** Patient 3 = mother
- learning difficulty at school
- 1 episode of depression
- autonomous in daily life but her level of education is very inferior to that of her two healthy brothers
- brain MRI (for transient visual disturbances) : left cerebellar lesion
*** Genetics testing
- CGH,FMR1, karyotype normal
- NGS : NM_007075.3 c.697C> T p.(Arg233Cys)
