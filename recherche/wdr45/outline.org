#+title: Outline

* Introduction
- NBIA = group of pathologies sharing the degeneration of globus pallidus and substantia nigra  due to iron accumulation
  - suspected on clinical feature + MRI
  - phenotype and genetics are heretogenous
  - unclear why only these structure are targeted (ether iron-riche structure are not affected)
  - more than 85% have a genetic etiology
  - classified by gene (so there may have overlapping phenotype)
  - Review in [cite:@hayflick_neurodegeneration_2018]

- BPAN = a subset, with a distinct phenotype (describe it)
  - first reported by
- Evolution
