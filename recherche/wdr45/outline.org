#+title: Outline

* TODO Introduction
- NBIA = group of pathologies sharing the degeneration of globus pallidus and substantia nigra  due to iron accumulation
  - suspected on clinical feature + MRI
  - phenotype and genetics are heretogenous
  - unclear why only these structure are targeted (ether iron-riche structure are not affected)
  - more than 85% have a genetic etiology
  - classified by gene (so there may have overlapping phenotype)
  - Review in [cite:@hayflick_neurodegeneration_2018]

- BPAN = a subset
  - first reported in 2012
  - distinct phetotypes : non progressive until adulthood ->> parkinsonism, dystonia and dementia

- Why this paper ?
* BPAN
** NBIA
- estimation 35-40% (Stige 2018)
** Phenotype
** MRI
** Therapy/management
- no marker but 1 case report with ENO2[cite:@takano_elevation_2016]
* WDR45
** Function (see [cite:@cong_wdr45_2021] )
- protein structure : N-terminal beta-propeller (definition)
- autophagy (update by [cite:@ji_upbeta-propeller_2021] )
- endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis
- mitochondrial alteration (morphology and function)
- iron homeostasis
** Other related diseases
- BPAN 66.4%
- Rett-like syndrome 2.1%
- intellectual disability 1.4%
- developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 12.1%
- early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) 2.9%
- West syndrome 2.1%
(the number of cases reported in given in [cite:@cong_wdr45_2021] )
