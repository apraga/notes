* Introduction
- NBIA = group of pathologies sharing the degeneration of globus pallidus and substantia nigra  due to iron accumulation
  - suspected on clinical feature + MRI
  - phenotype and genetics are heretogenous
  - more than 85% have a genetic etiology
  - classified by gene (so there may have overlapping phenotype)
- BPAN = a subset
  - first reported in 2012
  - distinct phetotypes : non progressive until adulthood ->> parkinsonism, dystonia and dementia
- Why this paper ?
  - expand the phenotype for male
  - 2 families with the same variant
* BPAN
** NBIA
- estimation 35-40% (Stige 2018)
- Review in [cite:@hayflick_neurodegeneration_2018]
- unclear why only globus pallidus and substantia nigra are targeted
- clinics and MRI are heterogenous : table 19.2 in[cite:@hayflick_neurodegeneration_2018]
** Early Phenotype
- described by [cite:@hayflick_beta-propeller_2013-1] : 23 patients
- initial diagnosis may be : atypical rett or epilepctic encephalopathy
- all = global developemental delay. Most had some gains over time.
  - IQ = 30-50 with expressive language severely limited
- most = broad/ataxic gait
- 13/23 epilepsy + treatement, with various types
- adolescence/early adulthood : dystonia, parkinsonism, cognitive decline (mean 25.3 years)
  - parkinsonism without tremor
  - L-dopa is effective but only for a short time
- additional features : disordered sleep (6/23), ocular defects (7/23), atypical Rett-like syndrome (7/23), bowel and bladder incontinence (most)
** Transmission
- most = de novo [cite:@hayflick_neurodegeneration_2018]
- some familial cases recorded
- male : not rare
** MRI
- may be normal in early childhood
- hypointensen signal in substantia nigra, globus pallidus
- FIGURE: hypoT2, halo T1 from [cite:@hayflick_beta-propeller_2013-1]
- pathognomonic : hyperintense halo in T1 in substantia nigra and cerebral peduncles

** Therapy/management
- no marker but 1 case report with ENO2[cite:@takano_elevation_2016]
* WDR45
** Function (see [cite:@cong_wdr45_2021] )
- protein structure : N-terminal beta-propeller (definition)
- autophagy (update by [cite:@ji_upbeta-propeller_2021] )
- endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis
- mitochondrial alteration (morphology and function)
- iron homeostasis
** Other related diseases
- BPAN 66.4%
- Rett-like syndrome 2.1%
- intellectual disability 1.4%
- developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 12.1%
- early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) 2.9%
- West syndrome 2.1%
(the number of cases reported in given in [cite:@cong_wdr45_2021] )

* Case report
** Family 1
- familial history: renal agenesis for the paternal grand-father, epilepsy in the maternal cousin of the mother
- 1 healthy sibling, French parents
*** Patient 1
  - pregnancy, birth N
  - age ??
  - neonatal: poor suckling
  - langage lay + fine motor difficulties
  - overlapping of left toes, mild hypertonia of lower limbs, mild dysmorphic features with bilateral epicanthus and hooded eyelids.
  - no epilepsy
  - metabolic, ophtalmologic, hearing N
  - MRI : bilateral and symmetric hypersignal of dentate nucleus in T2, without iron deposition
*** Patient 2 = sister
  - pregnancy, birth N
  - language delay, learning difficulties
  - round face, thick hair, short forehead and a right preaurical fistula.
  - hypermetropia and astigmatism
  - 12 years, no MRI
*** Patient 3 = mother
- learning difficulty at school
- 1 episode of depression
- autonomous in daily life but her level of education is very inferior to that of her two healthy brothers
- brain MRI (for transient visual disturbances) : left cerebellar lesion
*** Genetics testing
- CGH,FMR1, karyotype normal
- NGS : NM_007075.3 c.697C> T p.(Arg233Cys)
- de novo in the mother
- hemizygous in patient 1, heterozygus in the sistier + mother
** Family 2
*** Patient 4
- family : Algerian and French, 3 (2 ?) healthy siblings
- born 38 weeks, weight  -2.5 SD, length -1 SD, OFC
- neonatal : Suckling difficulties,  generalized hypotonia
- motor + speech delay
- No seizure 
- at age 4, weigh -2SD, height -1SD,  OFC -3SD
  - no dysmorphic features.
  - axial hypotonia, pyramidal syndrome in the lower limbs, mild peripheral hypertonia and bilateral nystagmus.
- Biological workup normal
- Ophthalmologic , hearing , EEG, cardiac normal,
- MRI : dentate nucleus hyperT2, + abnormal morphology
*** Genetics testing
- CGH,FMR1, karyotype normal
- NGS : hemizygous (NM_007075.3): c.698G>T ;p.(Arg233Leu)
- de novo
* Discussion
- 3 recent reviews  [cite:@cong_wdr45_2021], [cite:@saffari_quantitative_2021], [cite:@adang_phenotypic_2020] with a 19 male cohort
** Phenotype
- confirm the mostly neurological phenotype : developmental delay, abnormal cNS morpho, seizures
  - DI severe-profound, usually with speech disorder on the expressive or no speech
- Chronology
  1. developpemental delay/seizures in the first two years of life
  2. brain iron accumulation much later (median age = 11)
  3. Movement disorders, developemental regression, mental deterioration
- non-neurological:
  - facial dysmorphy
  - urinary incontinence
  - dysphagia
  - precocious puberty
- survival :[cite:@saffari_quantitative_2021]
** Phenotype : male and female
- [cite:@adang_phenotypic_2020] with a 19 male cohort
  - more profound development delay
  - more seizure in male but not earlier and more refractory epilepsy
  - earlier in male
- biphasic evolution for femail
- [cite:@saffari_quantitative_2021] seizures are more severe for male :
  - more motor seizure , especially infantile spasmes
  - more childhood onset epilpectic encphalopathies
  - more progressive encephalopathy
- more behavioural anomalies in mal
- but :
  - seizure not more frequent in male
  - onset is not earlier for males (at least statistically)
  - stereotypies only in female
  - movement disorder more pronounced in female
** Variants
- decipher : score for the gene
- /in silico/ score for our variant (varsome)
- predited consequence : no significative difference
- FIGURE: all reported variants
** Our patients
- phenotype
  - milder phenotype in female (family 1)
  - all patients have neurodevelopmental delay
  - no typical MRI iron deposit : too early ?
  - no seizures but not all reported case have them
  - no movement disorder : male are too young
  - neurologic symptoms in one patient, correspond to a subset of the phenotype (hypotonia)
- 2 very close missense variant, with different symptoms
  - C-terminal section ??
* Conclusion
  - BPAN is a recent diagnostic
  - the phenotype has been well studied with now over 160 cases
  - mostly severe phenotype
  - here we report both a de novo and an inherited new variants
  - with a milder phenotype
  - and 2 very cloose missense variants
