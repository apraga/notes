	abstract = {The WDR45 gene is localized on the X-chromosome and variants in this gene are linked to six different neurodegenerative disorders, i.e., ß-propeller protein associated neurodegeneration, Rett-like syndrome, intellectual disability, and epileptic encephalopathies including developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, early-onset epileptic encephalopathy and West syndrome and potentially also specific malignancies. WDR45/WIPI4 is a WD-repeat β-propeller protein that belongs to the WIPI (WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting) family. The precise cellular function of WDR45 is still largely unknown, but deletions or conventional variants in WDR45 can lead to macroautophagy/autophagy defects, malfunctioning mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum stress and unbalanced iron homeostasis, suggesting that this protein functions in one or more pathways regulating directly or indirectly those processes. As a result, the underlying cause of the WDR45-associated disorders remains unknown. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the cellular and physiological functions of WDR45 and highlight how genetic variants in its encoding gene may contribute to the pathophysiology of the associated diseases. In particular, we connect clinical manifestations of the disorders with their potential cellular origin of malfunctioning and critically discuss whether it is possible that one of the most prominent shared features, i.e., brain iron accumulation, is the primary cause for those disorders.Abbreviations: ATG/Atg: autophagy related; BPAN: ß-propeller protein associated neurodegeneration; CNS: central nervous system; DEE: developmental and epileptic encephalopathy; EEG: electroencephalograph; ENO2/neuron-specific enolase, enolase 2; EOEE: early-onset epileptic encephalopathy; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ID: intellectual disability; IDR: intrinsically disordered region; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; NBIA: neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation; NCOA4: nuclear receptor coactivator 4; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; RLS: Rett-like syndrome; WDR45: WD repeat domain 45; WIPI: WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting},

Mutations in the PANK2 gene account for the majority of NBIA cases and cause an autosomal recessive inborn error of coenzyme A metabolism called pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN). More recently, it was found that mutations in the PLA2G6 gene cause both infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) and, more rarely, an atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy that overlaps clinically with other forms of NBIA. High brain iron is also present in a portion of these cases. Clinical assessment, neuroimaging, and molecular genetic testing all play a role in guiding the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of NBIA.},

	abstract = {WDR45-related neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) is a clinically-heterogenous congenital disorder of macroautophagy/autophagy. The natural history of this ultra-orphan disease remains incompletely understood, leading to delays in diagnosis and lack of quantifiable outcome measures. In this cross-sectional study, we model quantitative natural history data for WDR45-related NDD using a standardized analysis of 160 published cases, representing the largest cohort to date. The primary outcome of this study was survival. Age at disease onset, diagnostic delay and geographic distribution were quantified as secondary endpoints. Our tertiary aim was to explore and quantify the spectrum of WDR45-related phenotypes. Survival estimations showed low mortality until 39 years of age. Median age at onset was 10 months, with a median diagnostic delay of 6.2 years. Geographic distribution appeared worldwide with clusters in North America, East Asia, Western Europe and the Middle East. The clinical spectrum was highly variable with a bi-phasic evolution characterized by early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy during childhood followed by a progressive dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome along with cognitive decline during early adulthood. Female individuals showed milder disease severity. The majority of pathogenic WDR45 variants were predicted to result in a loss of WDR45 expression, without clear genotype-phenotype associations. Our results provide clinical and epidemiological data that may facilitate an earlier diagnosis, enable anticipatory guidance and counseling of affected families and provide the foundation for endpoints for future interventional trials.Abbreviations: BPAN: beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration; CNS: central nervous system; DEE: developmental and epileptic encephalopathy; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; NBIA: neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation; NDD: neurodevelopmental disorder; NGS: next-generation sequencing; WDR45/WIPI4: WD repeat domain 45},

Mutations in the X-linked gene WDR45 cause neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type 5. Global developmental delay occurs at an early age with slow progression to dystonia, parkinsonism, and dementia due to progressive iron accumulation in the brain.
Methods
We present 17 new cases and reviewed 106 reported cases of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type 5. Detailed information related to developmental history and key time to event measures was collected.
Results
Within this cohort, there were 19 males. Most individuals were molecularly diagnosed by whole-exome testing. Overall 10 novel variants were identified across 11 subjects. All individuals were affected by developmental delay, most prominently in verbal skills. Most individuals experienced a decline in motor and cognitive skills. Although most individuals were affected by seizures, the spectrum ranged from provoked seizures to intractable epilepsy. The imaging findings varied as well, often evolving over time. The classic iron accumulation in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra was noted in half of our cohort and was associated with older age of image acquisition, whereas myelination abnormalities were associated with younger age.
Conclusions
WDR45 mutations lead to a progressive and evolving disorder whose diagnosis is often delayed. Developmental delay and seizures predominate in early childhood, followed by a progressive decline of neurological function. There is variable expressivity in the clinical phenotypes of individuals with WDR45 mutations, suggesting that this gene should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of children with myelination abnormalities, iron deposition, developmental delay, and epilepsy depending on the age at evaluation.},

We revealed that WDR45 and WDR45B are critical for autophagosome-lysosome fusion in neural cells. WDR45 and WDR45B, but not their disease-related mutants, bind to the tether protein EPG5 and facilitate its targeting to late endosomes/lysosomes. In Wdr45 Wdr45b-deficient cells, the formation of tether-SNARE fusion machinery is compromised. The macroautophagy/autophagy deficiency in wdr45 wdr45b DKO cells is ameliorated by suppression of O-GlcNAcylation, which promotes autophagosome maturation.

	abstract = {Background
Developmental delay (DD) is a neurological disorder that presents with defects in gross motor, fine motor, language and cognition functions. WD repeat domain 45 (WDR45) is one of the disease-causing genes of DD. Previously, WDR45 de novo mutations were reported in certain adult and pediatric patients due to iron accumulation.
Clinical report
We report five pediatric female patients with DD and epilepsy. Their ages were below 3 years at the first consultation, and precise diagnoses were difficult based on the available clinical information and phenotype.
Methods
Children with DD and/or epilepsy presenting to the molecular diagnostic center of Children's Hospital of Fudan University between May 2016 and May 2017 were enrolled. The patients and their parents were subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WES), and we characterized the phenotypes of the patients carrying WDR45 variants. Furthermore, we overexpressed the candidate variants in HeLa cells and evaluated their effect on autophagy through Western blot and immunofluorescence staining with confocal microscopy.
Results
Five WDR45 de novo mutations, namely, c.19C {\textgreater} T (p.Arg7*), c.401G {\textgreater} C (p.Arg134Pro), c.503G {\textgreater} A (p.Gly168Glu), c.700C {\textgreater} T (p.Arg234*), and c.912delT (p.Ala305Leufs*25), were detected in 623 enrolled pediatric patients (274 females; 487 patients younger than 6 years). All five patients with WDR45 variants presented with DD and epilepsy. Compared with the control HeLa cells, the cells with the p. Arg134Pro and p. Gly168Glu missense mutations showed accumulation of LC3-containing autophagic structures and an abnormally enlarged cell volume, and Western blotting revealed a significant increase in LC3II/GAPDH.
Conclusion
The identification of WDR45 mutations provides further evidence that WES plays an important role in the diagnosis of neurological disorders with common phenotypes and that WDR45 mutations are associated with neurological disorders and are not very rare in Chinese female pediatric patients with DD and/or epilepsy. The diagnosis of patients with WDR45 mutations would enable more precise genetic counseling for the parents of these children.},

WDR45 is required for autophagy, defect in WDR45 impaired autophagy which contributes for the pathogenesis of BPAN. Previously, we reported a novel de novo mutation (c.1040\_1041del, p.Glu347GlyfsTer7) in WDR45 (NM\_007075) in a 3-year-old Chinese girl with BPAN. Methods The protein structure was constructed using SWISS-MODEL and the isoelectric point (pI) was predicted by the online pI/Mw tool at ExPASy. The functional effects of this mutation were predicted by two online software programs: PROVEN and MutationTaster. Stable overexpression of Flag-tagged wild-type or mutant WDR45 in HeLa cells was constructed. Protein levels of LC3 and p62 were analyzed by western blot upon treatment with/without autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1, the formation of LC3 puncta were analyzed in HeLa cells transfected with mCherry-LC3 by confocal microscopy. Results The mutation resulted in a shift of pI from 6.74 to 8.84 and was predicted to be pathogenic. The protein levels of LC3-II and p62 were increased in cells overexpression of wild-type and mutant WDR45 while the protein levels were not increased in cells overexpression of mutant WDR45 upon treatment with autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1. Results from confocal microscopy revealed that LC3-positive puncta were increased in cells expressing both wild-type and mutant WDR45 while the number of LC3-positive puncta was not increased in cells expressing mutant WDR45 upon treatment with Bafilomycin A1. Conclusion Our study evidenced that this novel mutation in WDR45 impaired autophagy in cells thus this mutation is the cause for BPAN in this patient.},

	abstract = {Background
Static encephalopathy of childhood with neurodegeneration in adulthood is a phenotypically distinctive, X-linked dominant subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). WDR45 mutations were recently identified as causal. WDR45 encodes a beta-propeller scaffold protein with a putative role in autophagy, and the disease has been renamed beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN).

Case Report
Here we describe a female patient suffering from a classical BPAN phenotype due to a novel heterozygous deletion of WDR45. An initial gene panel and Sanger sequencing approach failed to uncover the molecular defect. Based on the typical clinical and neuroimaging phenotype, quantitative polymerase chain reaction of the WDR45 coding regions was undertaken, and this showed a reduction of the gene dosage by 50\% compared with controls.

Discussion
An extended search for deletions should be performed in apparently WDR45-negative cases presenting with features of NBIA and should also be considered in young patients with predominant intellectual disabilities and hypertonia/parkinsonism/dystonia.},

	abstract = {WDR45 and POLR3A are newly recognized genes; each is associated with a distinct neurodegenerative disease. WDR45 is an X-linked gene associated with a dominant form of Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA), manifested by progressive disabilities, dystonia, cognitive decline, spastic paraplegia, neuropsychiatric abnormalities and iron deposition in the basal ganglia on brain imaging. POLR3A, on the other hand, is an autosomal gene, and its mutations cause a recessive form of a hypomyelination with leukodystrophy disease, also known as 4H syndrome, characterized by congenital Hypomyelination with thinning of the corpus callosum, Hypodontia and Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism. We report on a female child with severe intellectual disability, aphasia, short stature, ataxia, failure to thrive and structural brain abnormalities. Brain MRI obtained in late infancy showed hypomyelination involving the central periventricular white matter and thinning of the corpus callosum with no evidence of iron accumulation. Brain MRI obtained in childhood showed stable hypomyelination, with progressive iron accumulation in the basal ganglia, in particular in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) identified a novel WDR45 frameshift deleterious mutation in Exon 9 (c.587-588del) and also revealed three POLR3A missense heterozygous variants. The first is a maternally inherited novel missense variant in exon 4 (c.346A {\textgreater} G). Exon 13 carried two heterozygous missense variants, a maternally inherited variant (c.1724A {\textgreater} T) and a paternally inherited variant (1745G {\textgreater} A). These variants are considered likely damaging. The patient's complex clinical phenotype and mixed brain MRI findings might be attributed to the confounding effects of the expression of these two mutant genes.},

	abstract = {Pathogenic variants in the WDR45 (OMIM: 300,526) gene on chromosome Xp11 are the genetic cause of a rare neurological disorder characterized by increased iron deposition in the basal ganglia. As WDR45 encodes a beta-propeller scaffold protein with a putative role in autophagy, the disease has been named Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN). BPAN represents one of the four most common forms of Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA). In the current study, we generated and characterized a whole-body Wdr45 knock-out (KO) mouse model. The model, developed using TALENs, presents a 20-bp deletion in exon 2 of Wdr45. Homozygous females and hemizygous males are viable, proving that systemic depletion of Wdr45 does not impair viability and male fertility in mice. The in-depth phenotypic characterization of the mouse model revealed neuropathology signs at four months of age, neurodegeneration progressing with ageing, hearing and visual impairment, specific haematological alterations, but no brain iron accumulation. Biochemically, Wdr45 KO mice presented with decreased complex I (CI) activity in the brain, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction accompanies Wdr45 deficiency. Overall, the systemic Wdr45 KO described here complements the two mouse models previously reported in the literature (PMIDs: 26,000,824, 31,204,559) and represents an additional robust model to investigate the pathophysiology of BPAN and to test therapeutic strategies for the disease.},
