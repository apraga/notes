# Outline
## NBIA
Neurogeneration with brain iron accumulation =  progressive extrapyramidal with accumulation of iron in the brain on MRI, usually basal ganglia
85% have a genetic basis and most of these are due to 4 genes: *PKAN2*,*PLA2G6*, *C19orf12*, *WDR45*. In total, 9 genes are reported.
Classification is based on genes.
Clincal and MRI may orient to a specific gene (Table 19.2 in [@haylick2018]).
Rare: PKAN is half of the case and its estimated prevalence is 1/1 000 000 [@gregory2002]

## Beta-propeller protein associated neurodegeneration
phenotype described in Gregory2002, Gregory2019.
Genetic basis in Haack2012, with phenotype detailed in Haylick2013 (20 subjects)

On chromosome X but no X-linked pattern : male and females are affected equally
Haack2012 hypothesis: 
- somatic mosaicism in male (germline likely not viable)
    - female somatic + germline
    - severity based on when and where the mutation occurs in embryogenesis (like in Rett's syndrome)
    - in favor : 2 DNA traces of differents peaks 
- skewed X inactivation
    - in favor : skewed in 10/12 women with WDR45 mutation
