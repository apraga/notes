# Conversion

2023-12-28: 
"As I stated in the tutorial, imo nvim-pandoc is the best solution now. Also checkout norganic tho, which might give better results in some cases. 

There’s also a project that aims to be a ts -> pandoc ast converter ([repo](https://github.com/VoreckLukas/norg-pandoc-rs)) but there’s no docs yet and you have to compile yourself. 

We are currently developing a new version of treesitter, which will be way better, and he is looking forward to upgrading (and also make the tool user friendly) once v3 parser is done.
