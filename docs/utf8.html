Text (and String) represent a sequence of unicode codepoints. These are numbers in the range of 0 to 0x10FFFF which have been assigned certain properties (including a name) by the unicode standard, such as U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E, which, besides the name I listed, is a Lowercase Letter. However, you canâ€™t put codepoints in a file, you can only put bytes. You need some way to translate codepoints into bytes. These ways are encodings, and UTF-8 is the most popular one. UTF-8 has the neat property that all the codepoints that correspond to the ASCII characters (U+0000 to U+00FF) are encoded as single bytes identical to their ASCII representation. But any other codepoint is encoded as multiple bytes.

<p>
So, U+00E9 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE (decimal 233) is encoded as the two-byte sequence 0xC3 0xA9 (195 162 in decimal). ByteStrings represent bytes, as found in the file. So to get back to the codepoint, you have to decodeUtf8
