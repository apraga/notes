Here, I'll explain how to configure FreeBSD to share media content over the network using NFS, and how to configure Kodi to access it from your TV.

== Server ==

First define which folders will be accessible to whom. In <code>/etc/exports</code>, I share /media to everyone on my network (192.168.1.**)

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell">/media  -alldirs -maproot=root -network=192.168.1.0/24</syntaxhighlight>
Note the syntax is different from Linux !

Then simply activate NFS by adding in <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> :

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell"># NFS for Kodi
# Order is important : rpcbind first, then nfs and mountd
rpcbind_enable="YES"
nfs_server_enable="YES"
weak_mountd_authentication="yes"
mountd_enable="YES"
nfs_client_enable="YES"</syntaxhighlight>
NB:Â The Kodi wiki mentions lockd and statd but it is unnecessary.

Reboot or start the service (start rpcbind first, otherwise it will not work !)

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell">$ service rpcbind start
$ service nfsd start</syntaxhighlight>
Check the export is working :

<syntaxhighlight lang="shell">$ showmount -e
Exports list on localhost:
/media                             192.168.1.0</syntaxhighlight>
== TV ==

We will use the Kodi application. Add a new source by choosing NFS and entering by hand : (the folder is not found automatically)

<code>nfs://192.168.1.XXX/media</code>

where XXX is the end of the server IP. Profit !
