1. Exploration

   Doc: [[https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/portal-data/external/dataDictionary]]
   food.csv: contient l'identifiant (fdc_{id}) et le nom (description)
   ex:
   "fdc_{id}","data_{type}","description","food_{categoryid}","publication_{date}"

   food_{nutrient}.csv contient l'information intéressante pour l'ID
   (fdc_{id})
   "id","fdc_{id}","nutrient_{id}","amount","data_{points}","derivation_{id}","min","max","median","footnote","min_{yearacquired}"

   Exemple : huile WESSON (fdc_{id} = 1105904) : foods.csv:
   "1105904","branded_{food}","WESSON Vegetable Oil 1
   GAL","","2020-11-13"

   A beaucoup de nutrients : food_{nutrients}.csv:

   "13706916","1105904","208","867","","71","","","","",""

   En enlevant ceux qui sont redondant, on retrouve 5 (différents des 3
   mentionnés ??) food_{nutrients}.csv
   "13706914","1105904","204","93.33","","71","","","","",""

   Les codes ne correspondent pas à nutrient.csv ou
   nutrient_{incomingname}. mais d'après le site
   [[https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1455596/nutrients]]
   (au passage, l'ID est encore différent) :

   - 204 = lipid
   - 208 = énergie
   - 606 = fat total saturated
   - 645 = fat total monounsaturated
   - 646 = fat total polyunsaturated

   En fait, le code est donné par nutrient_{nbr} dans nutrients.csv (!)

2. En résumé

   Requirements : food.csv, nutrient.csv, food_{nutrients}.csv

   1. Chercher l'ID dans food.csv (nom = description, id = fdc_{id})
   2. Pour fdc_{id}, obtenir la liste des nutriments (nutrient_{id})
      avec leurs valeurs (amonut) dans food_{nutrients}.csv
   3. Convertir l'Id nutrient (nutrient_{nbr} = nutrient_{id}) en son
      nom (nutrient_{nbr})avec nutrient.csv
