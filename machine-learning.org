#+title: Machine Learning

Methods
- linear model fitted by least squared = stable but possibly inaccurate
- nearest neighbours = precise but unstable

If the data is a set of tightly lustered Gaussians (theirs means are distributed as Gaussian), the optimal will be nonlinear and disjoint
If the data is a mixture of unrelated Gaussian, linear is almost optimal
