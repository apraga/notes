# Nix for genetics
## Powering a bioinformatics pipeline

We are dealing with real world patients = no mistake allowed !
- accurate results : no mistake is allowed (diagnosis can be life changing)
- reproducible : we need to have the trust of other doctors
- fast : increasing demand !

Rare diseases 
- ... are rare : how to diagnosis things you don't see often ?
- mix of state-of-the art technology, computer science and human expertise

Bioinformatics: 1 million -> 1 000 candidates


<!--
- How does that work in practice ?
- We start from a blood sample. DNA is then extracted and "sequenced" (getting the DNA code)
- Raw data cannot be used on its own so it needs to be processed and filtered.
- The final output is a dataframe (i.e CSV) than a human can examine and try to find the diagnosis.
- We still a human (no AI)
- And bioinformatics is super important : if we filter too much, we miss the diagnosis. Not enough and the human won't be able to read the data.

# Bioinformatics pipeline


```mermaid {theme: 'neutral', scale: 0.8}
graph LR
align --> call[call variant] --> annotate --> filter
db1([Database 1,2...]) --> annotate
db2([Database 5,6...]) --> filter
```

# Nix ? 

- Reproducible dependencies : ok ! (it's the law)
- High Performance Computing : ok !
- Manage workflow ?
- Manage databases ?

<!--

Quite simple : a set of command-line utilites that process (compressed) text data

External databases are basically text file .

How does nix fit into this ?
- hard-coded software version and dependencies -> that's an obligation for the laboratory. A small update means to run all checks... and there are expensive
- database could be managed ... but there are stored in a different folder. In theory it could be done (has been added a few month agay)
- manage execution ?

<!--

- Very welcoming (Element, github)
- Several packages contributed upstream (some waiting)
- Not easy as in my spare time + 5k in github
